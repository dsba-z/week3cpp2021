/// \brief      Main module for a Problem: How arrays appear in a C++ program
///             filter output
/// \author     Sergey Shershakov
/// \version    0.1.0
/// \date       22.01.2022
///             This code is for educational purposes of the course "Introduction
///             to programming" provided by the Faculty of Computer Science
///             at the Higher School of Economics.
///
/// TASK DESCRIPTION
///
/// 1) Define and declare three arrays a1, a2, a3 as it was shown in the lecture
/// slides.
///
/// 2) Try to assign a new initializer list with data, presented by the curly
/// brackets, to the array 1. Why it is not possible?
///
/// 3) Try to assign the array a2 to the array a1. Why it is not possible?
///
/// 4) Consider a tricky approach to calculate the number of elements of a
/// C-style (static) array using the sizeof operator. Iterate over all elements
/// of the array having its upper bound index.
///
/// 5) Create two arrays of char elements and initialize them by using an
/// initializer list and char literals. Consider one of them with the '\0' in
/// the end. Create one more initialized with a proper c-string literal. Inspect
/// all three arrays using a debugger (breakpoints and object inspector panes).
///
/// 6) Check the presence of a null terminator for the last (string literal)
/// array using the trick above.
///
/// For reference and pictures see slides after Lectures 4 and 5.
